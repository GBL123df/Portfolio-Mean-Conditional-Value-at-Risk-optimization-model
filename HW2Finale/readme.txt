This project is written in MATLAB language. We wrote a solver for the portfolio optimization problem, using a Mean-CV@R model to optimize it.
We tested  the model on the CAPMuniverse.mat dataset of returns. We compared our model with the MATLAB Financial Toolbox Model and we tried
to change some parameters or training datas distribution in order to see how our model works in every case.
