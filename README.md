# Portfolio_Mean-Conditional_Value_at_Risk_optimization_model
Project written in MATLAB Code where we create functions in order to solve the portfolio optimization problem with a Mean-CV@R model. 
We used our model on the dataset "CAPMuniverse.mat" . 
We tested the model against the MATLAB Financial Toolbox  model and tried to see how our model changes as passing different parameters or datas.
